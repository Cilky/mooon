Retries used: NONE STANDARD EXTRA ( extra retries remaining)

Engine requirements
========================================
yz38
    [ ] Advanced Physics
        [ ] Physical Entities are affected by friction
    [ ] Sound
        [ ] basic ability to play sounds clips
        [ ] (Optional) support for echo and reverb
hchao
    [ ] Data persistence 
        [ ] Basic data persistence model
            -check persistence class within persistence package of engine
        [ ] Engine support for saving and loading a basic file structure
            -check methods savegame, loadgame, saveconfig, loadconfig
    [ ] High Score
        [ ] Can output and read a simple high score board that is saved locally
            -check highscoremanager class within highscore package of engine


Game requirements
========================================
yz38
    [ ] Game uses friction
    [ ] Game uses a sound
hchao
    [ ] Game can save and load some data that changes the current state
        -press 3 to save sound as on, and load new config file (w just sound for now) into game
        -press 4 to save sound as off, and load new config file into game
        -check keypressed method for saving/loading data
        -press 2 to save game and go back to the home screen. press continue
         to continue playing where game left off
    [ ] Game uses high scores
        -on start, click scores to see current high scores
        -in game, press 1 to save high score. If the high score is lower
         than the current top 5, doesn't save, but if it is within the top
         5, then the score is saved.

Global requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin is an Eclipse project or has an ant build script
[ ] - Has README
[ ] - README explains how to verify engine requirements
[ ] - README explains how to verify game requirements
[ ] - README documents any known bugs
[ ] - README lists approximate hours to complete
[ ] - Has INSTRUCTIONS file containing instructions for playing the game
[ ] - No external dependencies
[ ] - Top level of all Java packages named with login
[ ] - Engine and game code in separate packages
[ ] - Engine and game code reasonably separate logicallyC
[ ] - Engine code well-designed
[ ] - Game code reasonably designed
[ ] - Works on department machines
[ ] - Does not crash under any circumstances
[ ] - Game works within tested resolutions and aspect ratios - 960x540 (1.778:1), 900x600 (1.5:1), and 1000x750 (1.333:1)
[ ] - Game is not drawn at a permanently fixed size
[ ] - Game has sufficient performance (30 UPS generally, 20 UPS spike min)


BUGS:
saving more than once makes the sound keep continuing on
rn, toggling sound with config file only changes text on screen, not sound yet
