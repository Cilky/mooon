Engine requirements
========================================
yz38
    [ ] Adaptive Difficulty
        [ ] extensible difficulty manager 
		- check level manager
        [ ] changes difficulty based on various input events
		- check level manager

hchao
    [ ] Smooth menus
        [ ] extensible supprt for menu/screen transitions
            [ ] 2 transitions (ie fading, lerping)
                -check UIShape and Screen class for fading and lerping capabilities
    [ ] particles
        [ ] can spawn particles and watch them move/fade/disappearze
                -check particle subpackage for particle class

BUGS: 
One time I tried to continue the last game, but it failed for an unidentifiable reason 
(I tried multiple times after this failure  and it worked every time, couldn't recreate the problem)
Takes a while to load "start game"- probably bc of particles? Had to add shape as a variable for collisions
high score gets updated after particle disappears
